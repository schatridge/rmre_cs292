_The Prices named below are subject to Revision on Publication._


#FORCED ACQUAINTANCES.# By EDITH ROBINSON. 12mo. $1.50.

A famous American author writes that this is "a very amusing and
well-told story, original and infinitely amusing. The differences in
character and temperament, the thousand and one little situations
that are derived from these differences, are very cleverly
delineated. The elaboration of the narrative, which winds along
through the household duties and the neighbors' peculiarities, is
something after the style of Miss Austen."


#THE LIFE AND WORKS OF GIORDANO BRUNO.# A new volume of the English
and Foreign Philosophical Library. 408 pages. 8vo. With portrait.
$4.50.


#FAMILIAR SHORT SAYINGS OF GREAT MEN.# By S. ARTHUR BENT, A. M. Fifth
edition, revised and enlarged. 12mo. Vellum cloth. $2.00.

Indispensable to students, writers, and libraries. It gives a
collection of short, sententious sayings of all times, such as are
constantly referred to, but are not to be found in other books of
reference. A short sketch of each speaker, and the circumstances
attending each remark, is also given. This new edition has been
thoroughly revised and corrected throughout, with new indexes and
tables of authors, and the addition of over fifty pages, bringing the
work down to the latest time, and quoting eighty authors not before
included, and containing over three hundred new sayings from Agassiz,
Choate, President Cleveland, Emerson, Evarts, Carlyle, Gladstone,
Wellington, Parnell, etc.


#THE COURSE OF EMPIRE.# Being Outlines of the Chief Political Changes
in the History of the World. Arranged by Centuries, with variorum
illustrations, by C. G. WHEELER. With 25 maps. 1 vol. 12mo. $2.00.

A very valuable historical work, which should be kept in every
library for reference and for the vigor of its delineations of the
great historic epochs.


#FAMILIAR ALLUSIONS.# A Handbook of Miscellaneous Information,
including the names of Celebrated Statues, Paintings, Palaces,
Country Seats, Ruins, Churches, Ships, Streets, Clubs, Natural
Curiosities, and the like. By WILLIAM A. WHEELER and CHARLES G.
WHEELER. 1 vol. 12mo. $2.00.


#EVENTS AND EPOCHS IN RELIGIOUS HISTORY.# By JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE,
D.D. Illustrated. 12mo. $2.00.

The Catacombs, as Cemeteries and as Martyrs' Retreats; The Buddhist
Monks of Central Asia; The Christian Monks; Augustine, Anselm,
Bernard; Jeanne d'Arc's Visions, Victories, and Death; Savonarola and
the Renaissance; Luther; Loyola; The Mystics--Neo-Platonists, German
Pietists, Fenelon, Swedenborg, Emerson; George Fox; The Huguenots,
Waldenses, Albigenses; John Wesley; The Moravians and Methodists.


#SONS AND DAUGHTERS.# By the author of "The Story of Margaret Kent."
12mo. $1.50.

An eminent Boston critic writes: "This should be THE novel of the
season. The lively fancy of the author touches lightly and wittily
upon several of the popular interests of the day, such as Shakespeare
societies, the Browning craze, mind cure, etc., and from titlepage to
finis there is not a dull paragraph. So brilliant and entertaining a
story as 'Sons and Daughters' is not often met with, and it should
have, as it deserves, the widest reading."

The remarkable popularity and great sales which made "Margaret Kent"
one of the foremost books of the last year (or of the last decade)
seem likely to be repeated in this new novel by the same author. It
sparkles with the real life and deep feeling, and has the same
admirable social setting, that have made "Margaret Kent" a name to
conjure by wherever the best of literature is known.


#HAPPY DODD.# By ROSE TERRY COOKE, author of "The Deacon's Week,"
etc. 12mo. $1.50.

"Happy Dodd" is a beautiful and tender novel of New-England life
especially adapted for home reading, and breathing out a
strengthening spirit of Christian love and heroism.


#SCOTT'S THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL.# Edited, with Notes and
Introduction, by W. J. ROLFE, A. M. 1 vol. 12mo. Beautifully
illustrated. 75 cents.


#THE EVOLUTION OF THE SNOB.# By THOMAS SERGEANT PERRY. 16mo. $1.00.

A keen and brilliant social study, by one of the most spirited
writers of Boston.


#GOETHE'S FAUST: A Commentary.# By DENTON J. SNIDER. 2 vols. 12mo.
$3.50.

A learned and valuable treatise on the greatest of German poems,
giving its history, critical standards, and outline, and careful
analyses and explanations of all the scenes and situations, as seen
from a philosophical point of view.


#SCOTT'S THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL.# An entirely new edition of
this famous and popular poem, from _new plates_, with nearly _one
hundred_ new illustrations by leading American artists. Elegantly and
appropriately bound, with full gilt edges. In box. Cloth, $6.00;
padded calf, tree-calf, or antique morocco, $10.00. A few copies in
crushed Levant, with silk linings, $25.00.

"The Lay of the Last Minstrel" is larger than its predecessors, the
Holiday volumes published under Mr. Anthony's supervision, and its
broad and handsome pages offer very favorable opportunities for the
display of the illustrations, which are masterpieces of modern
engraving.

The immediate and permanent success of "The Lady of the Lake,"
"Marmion," etc., has encouraged the publishers to bring out this not
less popular and famous poem. It is produced in the same style, and
with the same careful and elaborate style of illustration, regardless
of cost, while Mr. Anthony's skilful supervision is sufficient
guarantee that the work is elegant and tasteful as well as correct.


#THE PETERKIN PAPERS.# By LUCRETIA P. HALE. New Holiday edition,
revised and enlarged, uniform with "Davy and the Goblin." Square 4to.
Illustrated with a great number of new pictures. $1.50.

The continued popularity of these inimitable stories has compelled
the issue of this new and enlarged edition, with new illustrations
and type. "The Lady from Philadelphia," "Agamemnon," "Solomon John,"
and other characters of these stories have become household words in
thousands of American families; and the publication of a worthy and
comely edition of so delightful a classic will be hailed with joy by
many old friends and new.


#MURAL PAINTING.# By FREDERIC CROWNINSHIELD. 1 vol. Square 8vo. With
numerous diagrams and full-page illustrations. $3.00.

This series of papers has excited great interest and attention in
"The American Architect;" and in its present enlarged and amended
form, with many new illustrations, is still more valuable.


#THE VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN OF GENERAL POPE IN 1862.# Being Volume II. of
Papers read before the Military Historical Society of Massachusetts.
With Maps and Plans. 1 vol. 8vo. $3.00.

A careful and dispassionate account of the great retreat from the
Rapidan to the Potomac, with the stories of its terrible battles,
prepared by prominent military officers, and dealing with the Second
Bull-Run campaign, the Fitz-John Porter affair, and other interesting
matters.


#SONGS AND SATIRES.# A volume of poems. By JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE. 1
vol. 12mo. $1.00.

The range and versatility of these poems add to their other
attractions, and make the volume a very popular one. Mr. Roche's
_vers de societe_, printed in "Life," and other publications, are of
singular delicacy and originality, and the best of them are
incorporated in this volume, together with many heretofore
unpublished poems.


#GENIUS IN SUNSHINE AND IN SHADOW.# By M. M. BALLOU, author of
"Edge-tools of Speech." 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.

Mr. Ballou has for many years been known as one of the most
industrious, accurate, and entertaining of American scholars. The
present volume (his latest work) is a peculiarly interesting one,
full of anecdotes and _memorabilia_, which set forth the intimate
inner lives of the world's heroes and notables. They have been
gathered from the most recondite sources, and skilfully massed in
attractive array, forming a great collection, that is at once
valuable and interesting.

A WONDERFUL WORK OF ART.

Mrs. Browning's Love Sonnets.


#SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE.# By ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.
Illustrated by LUDVIG SANDOE IPSEN. 1 vol. Oblong folio (pages 13x16
inches), beautifully bound, gilt top. $15.00; full tree-calf,
$30.00.

This magnificent work has been a labor of love for years with the
artist, who is the prince of decorators, and has lavished upon it all
the resources of his imagination and skill. The result is a
magnificent monument to the poems that are enshrined therein, and a
series of designs, the equals of which as a mere treasury of
decoration and invention, apart from their significance in
illustrating the immortal verse of Mrs. Browning, have never been
issued in America. Each sonnet is prefaced by a richly ornamental
half-title, on a full page, and is surrounded by a handsome border,
emblematic in its design and composition. Mr. Ipsen has for many
years been recognized as the foremost leader of art-decoration for
books, both inside and outside, and has set more fashions for
imitation than any other artist. This book is his crowning work, and
will afford an inexhaustible treasury of decoration for students of
art, and a life-study for all lovers of beauty and symmetry. Mrs.
Browning's sonnets are among the noblest productions of ancient or
modern literature; and their literary excellence and incomparable
beauty of diction insure for them certain immortality.

#RECOLLECTIONS OF EMINENT MEN, and Other Papers.# By EDWIN PERCY
WHIPPLE. 1 vol. Crown 8vo. With new steel portrait of the author, and
preceded by the Memorial Address delivered by the Rev. Dr. C. A.
BARTOL. $1.50; in half-calf, $3.00.

A new book by Mr. Whipple is a literary event; and so many years have
elapsed since his last publication, that the interest will be more
intense in the present volume, which contains some of his most
charming and characteristic papers, including monographs on Sumner,
Motley, Agassiz, Choate, and George Eliot.


#STORIES OF ART AND ARTISTS.# By CLARA ERSKINE CLEMENT. 1 vol. 8vo.
Profusely illustrated. In cloth, $4.00; in half parchment cloth,
$4.50.

This work, historical and descriptive, gives a complete resume of the
History of Art, with accounts of the various schools, sketches, and
anecdotes of all the great artists, with portraits and reproductions
of their works. The author is well known as a charming writer and an
acknowledged authority on art criticism and history.

Minister to the Court of Persia. 1 vol. 8vo. With portrait and many
illustrations. Beautifully bound. $5.00. Half calf, $9.00.

The author is, perhaps, the best living authority on Persia, and this
book embodies the results of his observation and experience during
the years of his residence as United States Minister, combining novel
and entertaining adventures and descriptions, with political and
other observations of great value. His rare skill as a landscape
painter has availed to give many choice pictures of the great Asiatic
realm, with its stores of poetry and legend, its strange customs, and
its romantic scenery and architecture.

#THE HOUSE AT HIGH BRIDGE.# By EDGAR FAWCETT. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.

The announcement of an entirely new novel from the pen of the writer
of "Adventures of a Widow," etc., is sufficient to pique the
curiosity of many readers, who find in this author the best traits of
modern literature. "The House at High Bridge" is an entirely new
work, not having been published serially.

Duchess Emilia." 1 vol. 12mo. $1.00.

The book has deserved its success because more than any other of its
kind it is comprehensible, forcible, and readable."--_Commercial
Bulletin._

"The telling is remarkably well done. It is full of power and the
intensity of underlying tragedy," says Nora Perry, in _The
Independent._

"A bitter, caustic, stinging satire, a book of power."--_Chicago
Times._


#A MURAMASA BLADE.# A Story of Feudalism in Old Japan. By LOUIS
WERTHEIMBER. 1 vol. 8vo. Beautifully illustrated by Japanese artists.
$3.00; in red Japanese brocade, $5.00.

Mr. Wertheimber, of a scholarly Austrian family, went to Japan about
the year 1870, and spent many years there, in the service of the
Japanese Government. He was an extensive traveller among the inland
districts and villages; and contributed many articles and series to
the _Japan Mail_, and other publications. The present book is a
romance of the sword, full of charming local color, true to life as
it is in Japan, and full of deep and enchaining interest. Its
mechanical make-up is sumptuous in every respect.


#AGNES SURRIAGE.# A Novel. By EDWIN LASSETTER BYNNER, author of
"Damen's Ghost," "Penelope's Suitors," etc. $1.50.

Founded upon a romantic episode in early Massachusetts history,
introducing by name prominent people of the day, with descriptions of
their characters and appearance, weaving in historical events, such
as the Louisburg Expedition, Church Squabbles, and the Spinning
Craze, and giving a realistic picture of life under the royal
governors,--a book which, apart from the thrilling interest of the
story, is of permanent value as a painstaking study of an historical
epoch.

unfamiliar field. The result is a rarely entertaining volume of great
value to all scholars and public men, and interesting to all readers.
A small edition was privately printed some time since, and met with
such praise and appreciation that Senator Morrill has since carefully
revised and materially augmented it for publication.


#THE MINISTER'S CHARGE.# By W. D. HOWELLS, author of "The Rise of
Silas Lapham," "Indian Summer," etc. $1.50.

"In this great novel of the people Henry James finds that Mr. Howells
touches high-water mark; and sees an important and valuable work in
this minute and subtle registering of the heavy-witted countryman's
slow development under city conditions. However that may be,
Howells's pure, inimitable fun is enough to carry any story he may
write. Like all true fun, this has a most searching pathos all the
time just at hand; and never is the real dignity of character of this
actual Yankee forgotten or trifled with."--_Boston Transcript._


#COUNT XAVIER.# By HENRY GREVILLE. 1 vol. 16mo. $1.00.

This is the latest and one of the best of the novels of the author of

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
