                                THE BUS


The Bus is definitely the best bargain on Oahu. For 25c you can go just
about anywhere including around the island. School age children ride for
10c.

If you'd like to take the four hour trip around Oahu, board the #8 bus
to Ala Moana Center requesting a transfer to Kaneohe/Wahiawa (#52) or
Wahiawa/Kaneohe (#52). They both circle the island but in different
directions. If you stay on the same bus for the entire trip, you'll have
to pay another 25c at Ala Moana for the #8 bus which takes you back to
Waikiki. Should you get off during your trip and board another bus,
request a transfer to use at the Ala Moana Center.

=Remember=:

    Take exact change. Drivers cannot make change.

    Luggage and large parcels are not allowed on the bus.

    Waikiki buses are often full, but don't fret. They run every
        three minutes.

    Most of the buses you will take from Waikiki downtown (toward
        Honolulu or Ala Moana Shopping Center) should be boarded on
        Kuhio Ave.

    If you need a transfer, ask for one when you board the bus, not
        when you exit.

                       =Geographical Directions=

    Makai--toward the ocean

    Mauka--toward the mountains

    Diamond Head--toward the end of the island crowned by Diamond
        Head

    Ewa--the opposite direction from Diamond Head

Waikiki is where the action is--wave action and people action. This long
series of beautiful beaches is protected by an offshore reef a half mile
out. Conditions are ideal for surfing, outrigger canoe paddling and
catamaran sailing. The people come in waves that overflow the streets
and fill the high rises. The ebb and flow of humanity is a fascination
in itself.

Hawaiian royalty, it is today a monument to the jet age.

      Head view of things, call the Hawaiian National Guard for
      permission and directions.

  =Sunset Beach=--along with many other beaches along the north shore
      has earned a reputation as the world's foremost surfing coast.
      Winter waves running as high as 30 feet are an awesome sight in

                                SURFING


Waikiki's ideal surfing conditions--steady, dependable waves usually
from two to five feet--attracted Hawaiian royalty years ago. The surf
today draws enthusiasts from around the world. As a result, while the
waves are still excellent, especially for the novice surfer, there's
usually a crowd. For more maneuvering space and a change in scene,
surfers should head for one of Oahu's other great surfing beaches.

                                BEACHES


From time to time strong currents, high surf and turbulent water affect
every beach on Oahu. Dangerous waves and rip tides are common during the
winter months especially on the north and west shores and at Koko Head
Beach Park and Makapuu Beach Park. The safest beaches are those under
supervision of a lifeguard.

                                FISHING


How's the fishing? Stroll down to the International Market Place in
Waikiki and take a look at the marlin on display. There's your answer,
all 1800 pounds of it.

Fishing is a year-round pleasure and for saltwater enthusiasts there are
no seasonal restrictions, no limits and no licenses required. You can
also try your hand at surf casting, spin fishing, spear fishing and
fresh water fishing.

Honolulu boats fish for a mixed catch which may include mahimahi
(dolphin), Allison yellow fin tuna, giant bonefish, marlin, wahoo or
bonita. Kewalo Basin near Waikiki, the sport-fishing center for Oahu,
offers a fine selection of charter craft and experienced skippers.
There's usually lively action off Koko Head, in the open sea off Kaneohe
Bay or in Molokai Channel.

likely to get on this globe. Temperatures are generally in the seventies
in the winter; in the summer they creep up into the eighties. The
average range in Honolulu varies only seven degrees between August, the
hottest part of the year, and January, the coolest time. The difference
between day and night peaks is about 12 degrees. At Waikiki the ocean
fluctuates narrowly between 75 and 82. In other words, if it's summer
you want, you've come to the right place.

The island is air conditioned by northeasterly trade winds which blow
almost all the time and usher in an occasional shower. During spring and
summer these rains are few and come mostly at night. In winter the
trades are sometimes replaced by Kona winds coming up from the south
with sticky or stormy weather in tow. But Kona winds are infrequent and
rarely last more than a couple days.

Rainfall varies greatly according to local conditions. It's wetter to
the windward of the mountains and fairly dry on the leeward coast. The
average rainfall in Waikiki is about 20 to 25 inches per year, slightly
more in Honolulu.

                               OAHU'S PAST


The volcanic cataclysms that pushed Oahu through the surface of the
Pacific four to six million years ago originated in a fault in the
earth's crust at the bottom of the ocean. Complete with rumbling,
sputtering and spectacular fireworks, it was a dramatic premiere
performance. Today this gentle island, green and golden, belies its
violent birth. A millennium of rain, sunshine, waves and trade winds have
sculpted Oahu into a tropical jewel of lush valleys, mountains and
curved sandy beaches.

The Polynesians were the first to successfully sail the vast reaches of
the uncharted Pacific to land in Hawaii. They dragged their huge
double-hulled canoes ashore more than 1000 years ago. The original
inhabitants of Oahu from the Marquesas Islands were followed by several
waves of Tahitian immigrants.

Their primitive way of life came to an end with the arrival of Captain
Cook in 1778. By the middle of the 19th century Honolulu Harbor had
become a key Pacific port for whalers, sandalwood and fur traders. In
1850 the Hawaiian Royal Court moved permanently to Honolulu which has
been the seat of government for monarchy, republic, territory and state.

Immigrants came to Hawaii's tropical shores in continuing waves. New
England missionaries made their first hazardous trip around Cape Horn in
1820 bringing new concepts of religion, agriculture, commerce and
democratic government. As the native population dwindled due to western
diseases, laborers were needed to work the fields for the rapidly
growing sugar industry. Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants
followed by Koreans, Portuguese and Puerto Ricans added new languages
and cultures to the island population.

In 1893 a provisional government was set up to replace the monarchy and
one year later the Republic of Hawaii was founded. The islands were
annexed by the U.S. in 1898 and made a territory in 1900. In 1959 Hawaii
first flew the stars and stripes as a full-fledged state.

Today Oahu welcomes an astounding number of visitors to share its exotic
scenery, eternal summer climate and warm aloha spirit.

                          SUGAR AND PINEAPPLE


People the world over have enjoyed the sweet and succulent products the
Hawaiian Islands are famous for--sugar and pineapple. These are the two
most important agricultural industries in the archipelago. Pineapple can
grow at higher elevations and needs less water than sugar cane so the
crops don't compete for the same lands. Because Hawaii must import most
essentials from the U.S. mainland, the export of sugar and pineapple is
an important factor in the state's balance of trade. Also, with the
world running low on verdant spaces, sugar and pineapple are keeping
Oahu green.


                                 SUGAR

Sugar cane came to the islands in the hulls of the great canoes those
early Polynesians sailed across the Pacific. Hawaiians planted it as a
windbreak around their homes and broke off sections to chew when they
traveled.

The first sugar plantation in Hawaii was started in Manoa Valley on Oahu
in 1825 and the first export recorded was two tons in 1837. The Royal
Hawaiian Agricultural Society was instrumental in bringing the initial
shipment of Chinese laborers to work the fields in 1852. This was the
beginning of waves of immigrant workers who have contributed a wealth of
cultural diversity to Hawaii.

Cane on Oahu takes about two years to mature. The industry is highly
mechanized and has virtually eliminated hand labor. Just before harvest,
whole fields of cane are deliberately set on fire. This destroys
unwanted leaves and other trash and does not affect the sugar content.

Hawaii's sugar industry is recognized as the world's leader in sugar
technology and production and its workers are among the highest paid
full-time agricultural workers in the world.

                               PINEAPPLE


Pineapple was first introduced to the islands by a counselor to King
Kamehameha the Great in 1813. Today's industry got its greatest impetus
from Captain John Kidwell, an English horticulturist who searched the
world for a pineapple variety that would be most suitable to Hawaii. The
Jamaican variety known as the Smooth Cayenne which he introduced is
still the predominant strain grown in Hawaii.

In 1899 a young New Englander, James B. Dole, built a cannery next to
pineapple growing on his own lands in Wahiawa on Oahu. The first year's
output in 1903 was 1800 cases. Today the Dole company packs this amount
in just a few minutes.

Pineapple takes nearly two years of careful tending before it matures.
Then each low-growing plant yields only one fruit. A year later the same
plant will produce one or two more pineapples; then the whole process
must be repeated.

At harvest time, pickers move through the fields placing the fruits on
long-armed conveyors, a process which at the peak of the season
continues on into the night with the help of lighted booms.

Only those who have tasted a field-ripened Hawaiian pineapple know what
real pineapple is all about. The airport is full of enlightened visitors
who are taking cartons of these succulent fruits home with them.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
