  The frutefull sent[en]ce & the noble werkes
  To our doctryne wryt[en] [in] olde [an]tyquyte
  By many gret & ryght notable clerkes
  Gro[un]ded on reason and hygh auctoryte
  Dyde gyue vs example by good moralyte
  To folowe the trace of trouth and ryght wysnes
  Leuynge our synne and mortall wrechednes

  By theyr wrytynge doth to vs appere
  The famous actes of many a champyon
  In the courte of fame renowned fayre and clere
  And some endyted theyr entencyon
  Cloked in coloure harde in construccyon
  Specyally poetes vnder cloudy fygures
  Couered the trouthe of all theyr scryptures

  So hystoryagraphes all the worthy dedes
  Of kynges and knyghtes dyde put in wrytynge
  To be in mende for theyr memoryall medes
  How sholde we now haue knowledgynge
  Of thynges past / but by theyr endytynge
  Wherfore we ought to prayse them doubteles
  That spent theyr tyme in suche good busynes.

  Amonge all other my good mayster Lydgate
  The eloquent poete and monke of bury
  Dyde bothe contryue and also translate
  Many vertues bokes to be in memory
  Touchynge the trouthe well and sentencyously
  But syth that his deth was intollerable
  I praye god rewarde hym in lyfe perdurable

  Amonge all thynges nothynge so prouffytable
  As is scyence with the sentencyous scrypture
  For worldly rychesse is often transmutable
  As dayly dothe appere well in vre
  [Th]et scyens a bydeth and is moost sure
  After pouerte to attayne grete rychesse
  Scyens is cause of promocion doubtles

  I lytell or nought expert in poetrye
  Remembrynge my youth so lyght and frayle
  Purpose to compyle here full breuyatly
  A lytell treatyse wofull to bewayle
  The cruell swerers which do god assayle
  On euery syde his swete body to tere
  With terryble othes as often as they swere

  But all for drede plonged in neclygence
  My penne dothe quake to presume to endyte
  But hope at laste to recure this scyence
  Exorteth me ryght hardely to wryte
  To deuoyde ydlenesse by good appetyte
  For ydlenesse the grete moder of synne
  Euery vyce is redy to lette ynne

  I with the same ryght gretely infecte
  Lykely to deye tyll grace by medecyne
  Recured my sekenes my payne to abiecte
  Commaundynge me by her hye power deuyne
  To drawe this treatyse for to enlumyne
  The reders therof by penytencyall pyte
  And to pardon me of theyr benygnyte


  Ryght myghty pr[yn]ces of euery crysten regy[on]
  I sende you gretynge moche hertly & grace
  Right wel to gouern vpright your domini[on]
  And all your lordes I greete in lyke cace
  By this my lettre your hertes to enbrace
  Besechynge you to prynte it in your mynde
  How for your sake I toke on me mankynde

  And as a lambe moost mekely dyde enclyne
  To suffre the dethe for your redempcyon
  And ye my kynges whiche do nowe domyne
  Ouer my comons in terrestryall mancyon
  By pryncely preemynence and Iuredyccyon
  In your regall courtes do suffre me be rente
  And my tender body with blode all besprente

  Without my grace ye maye nothynge preuayle
  Though ye be kynges for to mayntene your see
  To be a kynge it may nothynge auayle
  Buy yf my grace preserue his dygnyte
  Beholde your seruauntes how they do tere me
  By cruell othes now vpon euery syde
  Aboute the worlde launcynge my woundes wyde

  All the graces whiche I haue you shewed
  Reuoule in mynde ryght ofte ententyfly
  Beholde my body with blody droppes endewed
  Within your realmes nowe torne so pyteously
  Towsed and tugged with othes cruelly
  Some my heed some myn armes and face
  Some my herte do all to rente and race

  They newe agayne do hange me on the rode
  They tere my sydes and are nothynge dysmayde
  My woundes they open and deuoure my blode
  I god and man moost wofully arayde
  To you complayne it maye not be denayde
  Ye nowe do tug me / ye tere me at the roote
  Yet I to you am chefe refuyte and boote

  Wherfore ye kynges reygnynge in renowne
  Refourme your seruauntes in your courte abused
  To good example of euery maner towne
  So that theyr othes whiche they longe haue vsed
  On payne and punysshement be holly refused
  Meke as a Lambe I suffre theyr grete wronge
  I maye take vengeaunce thoughe I tary longe

  I do forbere I wolde haue you amende
  And graunte you mercy and ye wyll it take
  O my swete brederne why do ye offende
  Agayne to tere me whiche deyed for your sake
  Lo se my kyndenes and frome synne awake
  I dyde redeme you from the deuylles chayne
  And spyte of me ye wyll to hym agayne

  In whiche I wolde be gladde to haue you in

  Alas good brederne with your mortall synne
  Why flee ye from me / to torne agayne begynne

  Yet to the deuyll ye go nowe wyllyngly

  Agaynst the worlde the flesshe and the deuyll

dicit dominus. Nonne satis pro te vulneratus sum? nonne satis pro
te afflictus sum? desine amplius peccare. [quia] magis aggrauat
vulnus peccati [quam] vulnus lateris mei.

  Am not I wounded for the suffycyent
  Haue I not for the ynoughe afflyccyon
  Leue more to synne by good amendement
  The wounde of synne to me is more passyon
  Than the wounde of my syde for thy redempcyon
  Thoughe I do spare I shall you desteny
  But ye amende to brenne eternally

  With my blody woundes I dyde your chartre seale
  Why do you tere it / why do ye breke it so
  Syth it to you is the eternall heale
  And the releace of euerlastynge wo
  Beholde this lettre with the prynte also
  Of myn owne seale by perfyte portrature
  Prynte it in mynde and ye shall helthe recure

  And ye kynges and lordes of renowne
  Exorte your seruauntes theyr swerynge to cease
  Come vnto me and cast your synne adowne
  And I my vengeaunce shall truely releace
  With grace and plente / I shall you encrace
  And brynge you whiche reuolue inwardly
  This is my complaynte to eternall glory.

  AMEN.

Unusual letters or letterforms

  Capital U/V is shown as "V" for consistency, although the letterform
  is closer to "U". Thorn [Th] appears several times at the beginning of
  lines, and once in an abbreviation; "th" is used everywhere else.
  A series of lines on page A.iiii. verso, starting with "ye neyther
  loue me nor my Iustyce fere", have initial lower-case "y". The first
  of these may have been necessary to avoid collision with the [Th] of
  theprevious line.

  In verse, nasal abbreviations such as [an] and [en] appear only in
  lines with large initial drop caps. Other abbreviations--mainly in the
  Latin passages--are shown in brackets:  [qui], [christi]. The word
  shown as [thou] was printed as "u" directly above "thorn" (not "y").

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
